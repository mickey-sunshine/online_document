msgid "ArkAngel require a number of PDK files when building an eFPGA IP. Therefore, the required PDK files are registered through a PDK configuration file (See details in :ref:`file_format_pdk_file`) Even though that ArkAngel has provided examples of PDK configuration files, the way to install any PDK may be different for each user. This tutorial helps users, who cannot use existing examples, create their PDK configuration file with detailed steps In this tutorial, a 40nm PDK is considered as an example"
