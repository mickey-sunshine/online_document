msgid "In eFPGA hardware, special buffers are placed near the entry points of the global network, as illustrated in :numref:`fig_ckbuf_concepts`. These buffers are used to constrain the mapping of internally generated global signals. The ``ckbuf`` insertion process is shown in :numref:`fig_ckbuf_process`. In this process, upstream logic generates ``internal_clk`` and ``internal_rst`` (internal clock or reset signals) from the global ``clk`` or ``rst`` inputs. These internally generated signals are then buffered with ``ckbuf``, producing ``internal_clk_buffered`` and ``internal_rst_buffered``, which are used as clock or reset sources for downstream logic. When an internally generated clock is mapped to a specific clock input, such as ``clk``, the corresponding clock buffer in the tile must be selected (e.g., ``CKBUF[0]`` in :numref:`fig_ckbuf_concepts`). Once a clock buffer is assigned, the associated global network port cannot be mapped to any other global signal."
