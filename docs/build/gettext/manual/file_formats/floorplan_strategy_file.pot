msgid "The floorplan strategy file is designed to provide scalable and adaptive floorplanning methodology across different FPGA architectures and PDK. The floorplan strategy file is loaded when creating or load a tapeout project (See details in :ref:`file_format_arch_template_file`) :numref:`fig_floorplan_concepts` illustrates the critical concepts applicable to floorplanning, which will be detailed explained in this section."
