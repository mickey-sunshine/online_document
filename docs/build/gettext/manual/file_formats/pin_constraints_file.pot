msgid "The *Pin Constraints File* (PCF) aims to create pin binding between an implementation and an FPGA fabric. It is a common file format used by FPGA vendors, for example, `QuickLogic <https://docs.verilogtorouting.org/en/latest/vpr/file_formats/#placement-file-format-place>`_."

msgid "The pin name of the FPGA fabric to be constrained, which should be a valid pin defined in OpenFPGA architecture description. Explicit index is required, e.g., ``clk[1:1]``. Otherwise, default index ``0`` will be considered, e.g., ``clk`` will be translated as ``clk[0:0]``."

msgid "The net name of the pin to be mapped, which should be consistent with net definition in your ``.blif`` file. The reserved word ``OPEN`` means that no net should be mapped to a given pin. Please ensure that it is not conflicted with any net names in your ``.blif`` file."

msgid "The default value of a net to be constrained. This is mainly used when generating testbenches. Valid value is ``0`` or ``1``. If defined as ``1``, the net is be driven by the inversion of its stimuli."
