Introduction
------------

ArkAngel is a unified platform by RapidFlex to develop and evaluate eFPGA fabric.
This include a number of critical development process:

- architecture exploration
- netlist generation
- design verification
- architecture evaluation
- *Qualty-of-Result* (QoR) extraction
- physical design
- sign-off

Depending on the needs during an eFPGA fabric development, the following editions are provided:

- Evaluation edition

  This edition provides fundamental features including architecture exploration and architecture evaluation. Customers may evaluate an existing FPGA architecture from the architecture library, or apply simple architecture modification.

- Prototyping edition

  This edition provides a tool kit including the features of evaluation edition, netlist generation, design verification and QoR extraction. Customers can perform a detailed *Performance, Power and Area* (P.P.A.) evaluation on their FPGA architecture which may be or based on one of the architecture library.

- Engineering edition

  This edition provides a tool kit including the features of prototyping edition, physical design, sign-off and full-featured QoR extraction. Customer can perform a full flow to generate the eFPGA IP for their FPGA architecture.
