# Getting started with AAEE

In this example, users will learn how to 

- Customize the number of I/Os in different types on each side of an eFPGA
- Check the I/O number, location and types of an eFPGA

The example FPGA architecture is the AlkaidC eFPGA under a S40 ULP PDK

## Source files

The ``project.xml`` includes an example project file start with
The ``run.arkangel`` consist of a working example script to run AAEE. User may modify upon their needs

## Quick Start

You may start AAEE in the interactive mode and type-in the command one-by-one

```
aaee -i
```

Or you may run AAEE in the script mode by
